# Machine Learning From Scratch
The most common machine learning models and algorithms programmed from first principles. The aim is to implement these models and algorithms to the same standard as widely used libraries such as scikit-learn with clean, efficient code, clear modular design, and rigorous adherence to the underlying mathematics.
