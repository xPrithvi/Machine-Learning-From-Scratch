    "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are a unsuperised learning method used for clustering. Compared to K-means, another popular clustering algorithm, GMMs are a soft-clustering method. This means that the classification of a data point $X_j$ to a given cluster is not certain, like in K-means (hard-clustering), but probabalistic. In GMMs, a given data point $X_j$ has the probabilities of $P_{j1}$, $P_{j2}$, $P_{j3}$, ..., $P_{jk}$, ..., $P_{jK}$ of belonging to each respective cluster $k$."
